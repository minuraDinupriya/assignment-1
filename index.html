    <div style="font-size: 30px; padding-left: 5%;">
    <p>
      <span style="color: red;">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown, fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span> 
      of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in New Zealand.

      The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms) rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).</div><br>

      <p><span id="bluebox" style="color: blue;">as</span> FAMILY LIFE</p><br><div style="padding-left: 5%;">Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr      during mating. Pairs do fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight to the death, although this is rare. <br><br>

      An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a more desirable one wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
      Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug by the male.<br><br>
